        <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
          to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
          attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
          these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the

          you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ is the perfect teacher. During his mortal ministry he taught spiritual principles that bring
          peace to this life and prepare us to eternal life. Christ wants us to live by the principles he taught so we
          may be transformed and become more like him. Christ did not live by a to-do list, nor did he constrain himself
          by specifically defining what good deeds
          he needed to do. Christ simply was what he was, and did good things because he is good.</p>

        <p>Jesus did
          not provide us a comprehensive list of all things that we must do, neither did he prescribered a closed and
          restrict set of behaviors for us to follow. Instead, he gave us plain and simple principles to guide our
          lives. It is part of our mortal journey to learn how to live by these principles with the help of the Spirit
          and Christ's example.</p>

        <p>Although Christ did not leave us a to-do list, he did leave his example. His life reflects all of the
          precious princples he taught, and we can learn to apply them in our lives if we simply look unto Him. Not only
          by knowing what he did, but sincerely studying his example, seeking to find him even in the small things. As
          we do, we will learn how to live the way he did.</p>

        <h3>Prepare Spiritually</h3>
        <p>Throughout this week, study the following scripture passages to
          learn of him. Think of ways on how you can apply these scriptures to
          yourself and your family according to your needs. Pray for

        <h3>Ideas for Family Home Evening</h3>
        <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
          share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make
          our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>Sing together Iâ€™m Trying to Be like Jesus (Children's Songbook #78). What kind of precious truths can you
            learn through this song? Think about the principles Christ taught. How you and your can live by those
            principles. Service is a good start, identify a service opportunity around your community or ward and make a
            goal as a family to go out and do it together.</li>
          <li>If you have small children at home, you can play "Simon says" with them. Teach them how Christ left his
            example for us to mimic in order to live by the principles he taught.
          <li>Choose a story from the <a
              href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/new-testament-stories?lang=eng" class="link"
              style="text-decoration: underline;">New Testaments
              Stories</a> book. Discuss with the children which principles are illustrated by the story you chose.</li>
          <li>Have a family movie night. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wcJSpw2A-Y" class="link"
              style="text-decoration: underline;">Finding Faith in Christ</a> together, and later discuss what
            you felt during the movie.</li>
          <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your
            study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great
            opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time
            to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More
            important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without
            words.</li>
