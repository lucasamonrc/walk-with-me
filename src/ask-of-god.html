      <h1>Week 4: Ask of God</h1>

      <div class="day-scripture">
        <p>"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it
          shall be given him."<br> - James 1:5</p>
      </div>

      <div class="record">
        <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
          to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
          attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
          these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the
          button below to create a note where you will record the impressions
          you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>As we learn from Christ and strive to follow his example, we will soon discover how difficult is the journey
          of the disicple. We will realize, however, how impossible life would be without it. In all of the hardships we
          will find along the way, the Lord promised to never forsake us.</p>

        <p>Repeatedly he affirmed that he would leave the Comforter to help us. He taught that if we would ask anything
          to
          the Father in Christ's name, having faith, it would be given to us. One of the most fundamental truths of
          mortality is our right to receive guidance, and God's satisfaction in revealing His will to us.</p>

        <p>As dark and dreary that life may seem sometimes, as terrible and confusing we may feel, there is one truth
          that
          we can hold on to. We can ask of God. We can ask guidance, we can ask help, we can ask questions. Our loving
          Father is
          desirous to grant us anything that is good if we should ask it of Him.</p>

        <h3>Ideas for Family Home Evening</h3>
        <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
          share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make
          our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>
