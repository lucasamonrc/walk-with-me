      <h1>Week 4: Ask of God</h1>

      <div class="day-scripture">
        <p>"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it
          shall be given him."<br> - James 1:5</p>
      </div>

      <div class="record">
        <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
          to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
          attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
          these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the
          button below to create a note where you will record the impressions
          you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

        <p>As we learn from Christ and strive to follow his example, we will soon discover how difficult is the journey
          of the disicple. We will realize, however, how impossible life would be without it. In all of the hardships we
          will find along the way, the Lord promised to never forsake us.</p>

        <p>Repeatedly he affirmed that he would leave the Comforter to help us. He taught that if we would ask anything
          to
          the Father in Christ's name, having faith, it would be given to us. One of the most fundamental truths of
          mortality is our right to receive guidance, and God's satisfaction in revealing His will to us.</p>

        <p>As dark and dreary that life may seem sometimes, as terrible and confusing we may feel, there is one truth
          that
          we can hold on to. We can ask of God. We can ask guidance, we can ask help, we can ask questions. Our loving
          Father is
          desirous to grant us anything that is good if we should ask it of Him.</p>

        <h3>Ideas for Family Home Evening</h3>
        <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
          share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make
          our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>Host a family movie night. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xVw6PsSinI" target="_blank"
              class="link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Joseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration</a>. After
            the movie, discuss how the principle of revelation guided Joseph Smith's life and ministry. Read together as
            a family James 1:5. What wisdom you lack right now? Write down your impressions and set plans to follow
            them.</li>
          <li>Invite the missionaries over to your house, and ask them to teach your family about the Restoration.
            Strive to invite a friend who is not a member of the church or that has been less active lately. Share your
            personal testimony of the Restoration, and personal revelation.</li>
          <li>Read Matthew 7:7-11 with your family, then hold a small scavenger hunt with your family. Hide small candy
            or items around your house and ask your family members to find it. When they feel that they are struggling
            to find these items, remember them that they can always pray for guidance. When you are done, come back
            share your testimony on how to receive revelation.</li>
          <li>Print a gospel picture (such as the First Vision) and cut the picture into twenty-four squares. Number the
            backs of the
            squares from one to twelve, repeating the numbers so that there are two sets, numbering one to twelve. Mix
            up the pieces
            and place them with the number side down, so that you see a scrambled picture. Turn over tow pieces at a
            time, trying to
            match numbers. When the numbers match, keep those two pieces to build the picture. If they donâ€™t match, turn
            them back
            over, leaving them in their original spot. The game continues until all the pieces are matched and the
            picture is
            complete.<br>(Idea from: Mina S. Coletti and Roberta Kling Giesea, The Family Idea Book Two, [Salt Lake
            City:
            Deseret
            Book, 1982], p. 217.)</li>
          <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your
            study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great
            opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time
            to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More
            important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without
            words.</li>
