        <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
          to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
          attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
          these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the
          button below to create a note where you will record the impressions
          you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>After asking of God, we need to be ready and willing to hear from Him. When we look to the few occurancies
          where the voice of the Father was heard, we will notice that his message is the same, he wants us to hear our
          Savior. The Father introduces the Savior, and bears witness of him. He repeatedly declared, "This is my
          beloved Son. Hear Him!"</p>

        <p>When we come unto christ by learning, looking, and asking, we need to learn how to listen to what he has to
          say. His message for us will be personal, and we will not be able to hear him if we are not willing to obey.
          Christ will speak through the Holy Ghost in our hearts and our minds, but we will only be able to understand
          it if we have real intent.</p>

        <p>We will be able to hear Christ when we seek him not to alter his will, but to receive. We will hear him when
          we are willing to act upon his personal intruction. And, once we hear him, we will be ready to walk beside
          him.</p>

        <h3>Prepare Spiritually</h3>
        <p>Throughout this week, study the following scripture passages to
          learn of him. Think of ways on how you can apply these scriptures to
          yourself and your family according to your needs. Pray for
          opportunities to share what you learned with others.</p>

        <h3>Ideas for Family Home Evening</h3>
        <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
          share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make
          our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>Print the proclamation "The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ -- A
            Bicentennial Proclamation to the World", frame it (if possible), and put somewhere in your house where
            everyone can see it. Read it with your family, and poder about the consequences that followed the First
            Vision. Dicuss as a family what Joseph Smith did in order to be prepared to Hear the Savior. Ask each family
            member to write individually what each one of them can do to be more prepared to hear the Savior.</li>
          <li>Create a simple obstacle course in your house. Take turns to go through the course blindefolded while
            other family members guide you through it without touching you. After each family member took a turn going
            through the course, liken this experience with Hearing the Savior. Ask them How does the Savior can guide us
            through this life's perils? How can we hear him better, and more often? Share a personal experience of when
            you heard a counsel from the Savior. Invite your family members to do the same.</li>
          <li>Choose one of the accounts where God introduced Jesus as His Beloved Son. Read them together. Create a
            simple table with your family to describe these accounts. You can use the model below:
            <table>
              <br>
              <br>
              <tr>
                <th>Place</th>
                <th>Event</th>
                <th>Audience</th>
                <th>Savior's Message</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Acient Bountfill's Temple</td>
                <td>After the land's destruction and darkness</td>
                <td>The Nephites</td>
                <td>He had glorified the Father in all things and fulfilled His will. Feel the tokens in his hands and
                  feet, and thrust the hands in his side.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </li>
          <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your
            study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great
            opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time
            to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More
            important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without
            words.</li>
