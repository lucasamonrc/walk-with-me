            As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
            to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
            attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
            these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the

            We chose to come to this world with hope that here we would obtain a
            precious knowledge that would give our existance greater meaning and
            joy. We agreed in forget the happy memories we had about our
            pre-mortal life, and we subjected ourselves to live by faith. We
            knew that we would be tempted, hurt, deceived; but, we knew of the
            imense joy that awaited us as glorified being of flesh and bones. We
            also knew that not every one of us would come back home in the end.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Heavenly Father provided a Plan through His Son, Jesus Christ.
            This Plan would lead us directly back to Him if we would allow it
            to. Christ fulfilled the Father's plan, and he became the only way
            back to our Father. Only through him, we will be able to return
            home. Only through him, the trials of this life will have meaning.
            Only through him, we will overcome and be made whole to be welcomed
            back to our only home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jesus Christ, is The Way back to the Father. As we come to know him
            more perfectly, we will be inspired to do things that will direct us
            back home. No other doctrine, teaching, or individual will lead us
            safely back home, for he is "the way, the truth, and the life".

            Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
