            As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
            to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
            attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
            these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the

            We chose to come to this world with hope that here we would obtain a
            precious knowledge that would give our existence greater meaning and
            joy. We agreed to forget the happy memories we had about our
            pre-mortal life, and we subjected ourselves to live by faith. We
            knew that we would be tempted, hurt, deceived; but, we knew of the
            imense joy that awaited us as glorified beings of flesh and bones.
            We also knew that not every one of us would come back home in the
            end.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Heavenly Father provided a Plan through His Son, Jesus Christ.
            This Plan would lead us directly back to Him if we would allow it
            to. Christ fulfilled the Father's plan, and he became the only way
            back to God. Only through him, we will be able to return home. Only
            through him, the trials of this life will have meaning. Only through
            him, we will overcome and be made whole to be welcomed back to our
            only home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jesus Christ, is The Way back to the Father. As we come to know him
            more perfectly, we will be inspired to do things that will direct us
            back home. No other doctrine, teaching, or individual will lead us
            safely back home, for he is the only "way, the truth, and the life".

          <p>
            Throughout this week, study the following scripture passages to
            learn more about The Way. Think of ways on how you can apply these
            scriptures to yourself and your family according to your needs. Pray
            for opportunities to share what you learned with others.

          <h3>Ideas for Family Home Evening</h3>
          <p>
            Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
            share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make
            our homes the main...
          </p>
          <ul class="lesson-list">
            <li>
              There is great power in singing and praying as a family. Strive to
              always start your Family Home Evenings with a song and a prayer.
              Think of songs that talk about our Father's Plan or of the Gospel
              of Jesus Christ as you share about The Way during this week. Songs
              like "Press Forward Saints #81" or "I am a Child of God #301" are
              particularly appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read Lehi's account on the vision of the Tree of Life as found in
              1 Nephi 8. Strive to identify each element of the vision and
              understand them as a family. You can assign each family member a
              different element like the Tree of Life, The Iron Rod, The Mist of
              Darkness, etc, and then have each one share how we can identify
              these different elements in our daily lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Draw a picture where two people are separated by a great cliff.
              Ask your family what would help these people overcome the great
              cliff? After sincerely listening to their answers, read John 14:6
              together. Explain that if were not by what Jesus did, we would
              forever be separated from our Heavenly Father, just as those two
              people in the picture. Share with your family examples of when you
              felt Christ being "the way, the truth, and the life" in your
              personal life. Ask them to share their testimonies about Jesus
              Christ.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read 2 Nephi 31 together, and identify the Gospel principles that
              Nephi teaches to be essential to our salvation. Write these
              principles down as a family and put it somewhere where all in the
              house can see often. Discuss as family how these principles can be
              better incorporated into your daily lives and into your
              relationships with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your
              study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great
              opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time
              to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More
              important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without
              words.
