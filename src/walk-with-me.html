      <h1>Week 6: "Walk With Me"</h1>

      <div class="day-scripture">
        <p>"(...); and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me."<br> - Moses 6:34</p>

        <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come
          to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay
          attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to
          these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the
          button below to create a note where you will record the impressions
          you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <div class="summary">
        <p>The work of God is to "(...) bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." (Moses 1:39). In other
          words, the purpose of God is to make us like Him. Indeed, we are gods in embryo; as His children, we did
          inherit a divine potential for glory and eternal life. As we hear Christ, and tap into his grace to become
          more than we could ever be, we unlock this divine potential and become more like Him.</p>

        <p>Thousands of years ago a humble lad slow in speech, and hated by man, was called by God to preach the
          Evarlasting Gospel; his name was Enoch. Christ's grace enabled him to perform a such kind of work that
          converted an entire city that in the end was taken away from the earth because of the righteousness of its
          inhabitants. Enoch was taught the way, he learned from Christ, he looked to Christ, he directed
          his questions to Christ, he hearkened to Christ, and eventually he walked with Christ.</p>

        <p>If Enoch and Zion learned to walk with Christ, so can we. We walk with Christ when we make his will our own.
          We walk with Christ when we put off the natural man or woman in us. We walk with Christ when we obey his
          commandments, even if the path before us seems dark. We walk with Christ when we make ourselves his friends.
          We walk with Christ when we strive to be faithful and true disciples. And should we fail to do any of these
          things, should we experience discouragement, temptations, shortcomings, and heartbreak, we can be sure of one
          thing; Christ will always walk with us. We may not see it of even feel it at times; however, he will always be
          there every step of the way. He will patiently wait until we are ready to begin again, and walk with him.</p>

        <h3>Prepare Spiritually</h3>
        <p>Throughout this week, study the following scripture passages to
          learn of him. Think of ways on how you can apply these scriptures to
          yourself and your family according to your needs. Pray for
          opportunities to share what you learned with others.</p>

        <h3>Ideas for Family Home Evening</h3>
        <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we
          share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make
          our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>
        <ul class="lesson-list">
          <li>If you are a parent, take time this week to have an alone-time with each one of your children. Do
            something fun with them, interview them, let them know of your love for them. Share with them how important
            the Gospel is in your life, and share the story of Enoch and the city of Zion. Write down in your journal
            this experience.</li>
          <li>Have a family walk. Choose a very specific destination, it can be a walk around the neighborhood going
            towards your chapel, or maybe it could even be a walk to the Temple if you live nearby to one. Just walk
            with your family, enjoy your time together to talk and learn from each other. Then read together Moses
            6:27-30. Discuss what does it mean to walk with God? What does your family need to do to walk together with
            Christ.</li>
          <li>Watch together the <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=yL5jobrN3ck" target="_blank" class="link"
              style="text-decoration: underline;">Jesus Warns Peter and Offers the Intercessory Prayer</a> Bible Video.
            Ask your family what draws their attention in Jesus' prayer. Ask them what does it mean to have a knowledge
            of God and of Jesus Christ?</li>
          <li>Try this idea from Adelle Belnap:<br>
            Draw 8-10 big footprints in a line (You can use sidewalk chalk, or sticks to draw in the dirt, or even make
            paper footprints and
            write on them with markers. The concept is the
            same!). Let your children list some steps they take that show they are walking by faith. It can be some
            things from the family
            night lesson or some new ideas! Write the words in the footprints. Then, walk along the path of footprints.
            Talk about how easy it is to take each small step. It is not hard to follow in the Savior’s footprints. He
            helps us and
            guides us along. Sometimes it’s hard to know what comes next in life and sometimes pressing forward can
            actually seem scary. But, God
            will be by our side and direct our path, as we continue on, committed to following Him. (Idea by Adelle
            Belnap, August 5 2019).
          </li>
          <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your
            study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great
            opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time
            to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More
            important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without
            words.</li>
