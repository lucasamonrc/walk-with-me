        <p>"(...), I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."

      <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>We chose to come to this world with hope that here we would obtain a precious knowledge that would give our existence greater meaning and joy. We agreed to forget the happy memories we had about our pre-mortal life, and we subjected ourselves to live by faith. We knew that we would be tempted, hurt, deceived; but, we knew of the imense joy that awaited us as glorified beings of flesh and bones. We also knew that not every one of us would come back home in the end.</p>

      <p>Our Heavenly Father provided a Plan through His Son, Jesus Christ. This Plan would lead us directly back to Him if we would allow it to. Christ fulfilled the Father's plan, and he became the only way back to God. Only through him, we will be able to return home. Only through him, the trials of this life will have meaning. Only through him, we will overcome and be made whole to be welcomed back to our only home.</p>

      <p>Jesus Christ, is The Way back to the Father. As we come to know him more perfectly, we will be inspired to do things that will direct us back home. No other doctrine, teaching, or individual will lead us safely back home, for he is the only "way, the truth, and the life".

      <h2 class="section-title">Record Impressions</h2>
      
      <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the button below to create a note where you will record the impressions you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Ideas for Family Home Evening</h2>
      
      <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>

      <ul class="lesson-plans">
        <li>There is great power in singing and praying as a family. Strive to always start your Family Home Evenings with a song and a prayer. Think of songs that talk about our Father's Plan or of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as you share about The Way during this week. Songs like "Press Forward Saints #81" or "I am a Child of God #301" are particularly appropriate.</li>
        <li>Read Lehi's account on the vision of the Tree of Life as found in 1 Nephi 8. Strive to identify each element of the vision and understand them as a family. You can assign each family member a different element like the Tree of Life, The Iron Rod, The Mist of Darkness, etc, and then have each one share how we can identify these different elements in our daily lives.</li>
        <li>Draw a picture where two people are separated by a great cliff. Ask your family what would help these people overcome the great cliff? After sincerely listening to their answers, read John 14:6 together. Explain that if were not by what Jesus did, we would forever be separated from our Heavenly Father, just as those two people in the picture. Share with your family examples of when you felt Christ being "the way, the truth, and the life" in your personal life. Ask them to share their testimonies about Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>Read 2 Nephi 31 together, and identify the Gospel principles that Nephi teaches to be essential to our salvation. Write these principles down as a family and put it somewhere where all in the house can see often. Discuss as family how these principles can be better incorporated into your daily lives and into your relationships with each other.</li>
        <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without words.</li>
