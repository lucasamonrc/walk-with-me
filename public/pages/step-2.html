      <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>By understanding that Jesus Christ is the only way back to our Heavenly Parents we gave our first steps towards lasting conversion. Indeed, Faith in Jesus Christ is the first principle of the Gospel. However, belief alone is not a true demonstration of faith.</p>

      <p>Faith is a principle of power and knowledge. Faith in Jesus Christ starts with believing in him, this will lead us to learning about him and from him; and once we learn, the Spirit will testify of the truth to our hearts because we lived what we learned. Faith is made of belief, learning, and action.</p>

      <p>Christ's invitation to learn of him is an invitation to believe in him, and to obey to his words. When we learn of Christ, of his life, his stories, his deeds, we learn the pattern of life that Heavenly Father desires for us and for our family. When we learn of Christ, we learn of our purpose in life, and of our Heavenly Father's high and sacred expectations for us.

      <h2 class="section-title">Record Impressions</h2>
      
      <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the button below to create a note where you will record the impressions you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Ideas for Family Home Evening</h2>
      
      <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>

      <ul class="lesson-plans">
        <li>Read Doctrine and Convenants 19:13-20, 23-24 together as a family. Give the proper historical context for this passage, and then ask why does the Lord want us to learn from Him? What does he want us to learn of Him? What ways can we better learn of Him? Write the answers down and make a family plan to incorporate these answers in your daily lives.</li>

        <li>Place a bowl full of candy in front of your family members. Give each one of them a piece of paper, and tell them that they can have as much candy as they want, but only after they successfully make a paper boat. Some of them may struggle, while others may find it easier. After their failed first attempt, give each one a new piece of paper and ask them to try again. This time, however, you will guide step by step (<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Paper-Boat" target="_blank">see instructrions here</a>) so all family members can finish. Liken this activity to how the Savior has high expectations for us, but He will guide us every step of the way. Read Matthew 11:27-30 together, share your testimony and enjoy the candy.</li>

        <li>Find things that you can learn together as a family. It can be a new cooking or baking recipe, a type of craft or artwork, a professional skill, and even a school discipline. Spend sometime together trying to learn this, then share of what was hard about it ans what was easy. Ask your family members how having a teacher or someone with more experience could have helped to learn this skill better. Liken this experience to how the Savior is our teacher, and bear testimony of his teachings.</li>

        <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without words.</li>
