        <hr>
        <p>"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
          - James 1:5</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>As we learn from Christ and strive to follow his example, we will soon discover how difficult is the journey of the disicple. We will realize, however, how impossible life would be without it. In all of the hardships we will find along the way, the Lord promised to never forsake us.</p>

      <p>Repeatedly he affirmed that he would leave the Comforter to help us. He taught that if we would ask anything to the Father in Christ's name, having faith, it would be given to us. One of the most fundamental truths of mortality is our right to receive guidance, and God's satisfaction in revealing His will to us.</p>

      <p>As dark and dreary that life may seem sometimes, as terrible and confusing we may feel, there is one truth that we can hold on to. We can ask of God. We can ask guidance, we can ask help, we can ask questions. Our loving Father is desirous to grant us anything that is good if we should ask it of Him.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Record Impressions</h2>
      
      <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the button below to create a note where you will record the impressions you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Ideas for Family Home Evening</h2>
      
      <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>

      <ul class="lesson-plans">
        <li>Host a family movie night. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xVw6PsSinI" target="_blank">Joseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration.</a> After the movie, discuss how the principle of revelation guided Joseph Smith's life and ministry. Read together as a family James 1:5. What wisdom you lack right now? Write down your impressions and set plans to follow them.</li>

        <li>Invite the missionaries over to your house, and ask them to teach your family about the Restoration. Strive to invite a friend who is not a member of the church or that has been less active lately. Share your personal testimony of the Restoration, and personal revelation.</li>

        <li>Read Matthew 7:7-11 with your family, then hold a small scavenger hunt with your family. Hide small candy or items around your house and ask your family members to find it. When they feel that they are struggling to find these items, remember them that they can always pray for guidance. When you are done, come back share your testimony on how to receive revelation.</li>

        <li>Print a gospel picture (such as the First Vision) and cut the picture into twenty-four squares. Number the backs of the squares from one to twelve, repeating the numbers so that there are two sets, numbering one to twelve. Mix up the pieces and place them with the number side down, so that you see a scrambled picture. Turn over tow pieces at a time, trying to match numbers. When the numbers match, keep those two pieces to build the picture. If they donâ€™t match, turn them back over, leaving them in their original spot. The game continues until all the pieces are matched and the picture is complete. (Idea from: Mina S. Coletti and Roberta Kling Giesea, The Family Idea Book Two, [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1982], p. 217.)</li>

        <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without words.</li>
