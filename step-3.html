      <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>Jesus Christ is the perfect teacher. During his mortal ministry he taught spiritual principles that bring peace to this life and prepare us to eternal life. Christ wants us to live by the principles he taught so we may be transformed and become more like him. Christ did not live by a to-do list, nor did he constrain himself by specifically defining what good deeds he needed to do. Christ simply was what he was, and did good things because he is good.</p>

      <p>Jesus did not provide us a comprehensive list of all things that we must do, neither did he prescribered a closed and restrict set of behaviors for us to follow. Instead, he gave us plain and simple principles to guide our lives. It is part of our mortal journey to learn how to live by these principles with the help of the Spirit and Christ's example.</p>

      <p>Although Christ did not leave us a to-do list, he did leave his example. His life reflects all of the precious princples he taught, and we can learn to apply them in our lives if we simply look unto Him. Not only by knowing what he did, but sincerely studying his example, seeking to find him even in the small things. As we do, we will learn how to live the way he did.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Record Impressions</h2>
      
      <p>As we study the scriptures we need to be aware of thoughts that come to our mind. The Spirit will speak to our hearts and minds as we pay attention to our feelings and insights. We show appreciation to these promptings when we record them in a sacred place. Use the button below to create a note where you will record the impressions you have as you study this week's lesson.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Ideas for Family Home Evening</h2>
      
      <p>Just as with any principle, spiritual knowledge is enlarged when we share it with others. We were instructed by living prophets to make our homes the main center of gospel learning.</p>

      <ul class="lesson-plans">
        <li>Sing together Iâ€™m Trying to Be like Jesus (Children's Songbook #78). What kind of precious truths can you learn through this song? Think about the principles Christ taught. How you and your can live by those principles. Service is a good start, identify a service opportunity around your community or ward and make a goal as a family to go out and do it together.</li>

        <li>If you have small children at home, you can play "Simon says" with them. Teach them how Christ left his example for us to mimic in order to live by the principles he taught.</li>

        <li>Choose a story from the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/new-testament-stories?lang=eng" target="_blank">New Testaments Stories book.</a> Discuss with the children which principles are illustrated by the story you chose.</li>

        <li>Have a family movie night. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wcJSpw2A-Y" target="_blank">Finding Faith in Christ</a> together, and later discuss what you felt during the movie.</li>

        <li>Ponder other ways that you can share what you learned in your study with your family. Remember, Family Home Evening is a great opportunity to teach the Gospel, but most importantly it is a time to disconnect and and spend time together as a family. More important than what you say, is what being felt and taught without words.</li>
