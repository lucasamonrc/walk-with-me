      <p>The goal of every disciple of Jesus Christ is to become like his/her master. In order to do so, we need to live by his principles and learn to walk by his side. The purpose of this program is help families and individuals to turn their thoughts to this simple invitation "walk with me", and make the necessary changes in life through family gospel teaching and sharing. This will be better accomplished through Family Home Evening, but the suggestions contained in these pages can go far beyond it.</p>

      <p>Each week you will find a small summary of the week's principle, along with a set of scriptures and talks that expand the weekly principle. These scriptures will give the spiritual foundation for you to prepare with a family a Family Home Evening centered around the week's principle.</p>

      <p>The suggestions listed under the "Family Home Evening Ideas" are far from complete, and much less are they the only possible ideas to share the princples with your family. These suggestions are only a starting point; ultimately it is completely up to you and your family to decide, with the help of the Lord, how you are going to share these principles with your family in a way that will prepare you and your loved ones to walk with Christ throughout your lives.</p>
