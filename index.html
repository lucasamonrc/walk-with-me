      <h1>Walk With Me</h1>
      <p>
        A 6-week Family Home Evening program focused in learning about Christ
        and how to walk with Him.
      </p>

      <div class="day-scripture">
        <h3>Scripture of the Day</h3>
        <p>"Scripture" - Reference 1:1</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-center">Introduction</h3>
      <br><br>

      <p>Throughout Christ's pre-mortal, mortal, and pos-mortal ministry he issued several invitations. "Come follow
        me", "Go, and sin no more", "Come unto me", "Love one another", "Take up thy cross, and follow me", etc. One of
        the most profound and touching invitations was "walk with me."</p>

      <p>The goal of every disciple of Jesus Christ is to become like his/her master. In order to do so, we need to live
        by his principles and learn to walk by his side. The purpose of this program is help families and individuals to
        turn their thoughts to this simple invitation "walk with me", and make the necessary changes in life through
        family gospel teaching and sharing. This will be better accomplished through Family Home Evening, but the
        suggestions contained in these pages can go far beyond it</p>

      <p>Each week you will find a small summary of the week's principle, along with a set of scriptures and talks that
        expand the weekly principle. These scriptures will give the spiritual foundation for you to prepare with a
        family a Family Home Evening centered around the week's principle.</p>

      <p>The suggestions listed under the "Family Home Evening Ideas" are far from complete, and much less are they the
        only possible ideas to share the princples with your family. These suggestions are only a starting point;
        ultimately it is completely up to you and your family to decide, with the help of the Lord, how you are going to
        share these principles with your family in a way that will prepare you and your loved ones to walk with Christ
        throughout your lives.</p>
